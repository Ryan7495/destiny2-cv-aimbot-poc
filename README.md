## About The Project

This computer vision aimbot provides character detection and targeting for video games that use humanoid character models. This aimbot approach is targeted at cloud hosted games as they are immune to tradisional cheats. Tradisional cheats require access to client side process memory, object code and network traffic. With cloud hosted games the user has no way to tamper with the internals of the game. 

This project is mainly a proof of concept as the computational requirements and level of performance makes this approach is impractical.
